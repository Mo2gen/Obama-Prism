## What the fuck is this?
Ever wondered what kind of mod would be produced when someone stays up until 5am with a friend and fills a random hoi4 state map? Yeah this kinda shit happens. Expect lots of weird shit, shitty code and experimental features as you join me in my modding journy

## Things i like to complain about
```
|  	| Issue-Name 	| Complaint 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 1 	| GUI 	| Annoying af layer issues, at least its easy to debug 	|
| 2 	| Image files 	| Why use TARGA and DDS? Old af and annoying to work with 	|
| 3 	| Music/Sounds 	| Unless you really want to mix it, why have two files for music/sounds 	|
```
